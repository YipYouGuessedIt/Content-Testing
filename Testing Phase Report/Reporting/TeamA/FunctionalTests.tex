If the use case implementation was successful:
\paragraph{Requirement 1}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
	1. It provides statistical information that can be used in the interface to display facts about the average user and how the logged-in user compares with the average.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.

\paragraph{Requirement 2}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
2. It provides ways to gather data that is in the persistent store and present it in a format that
is usable by other modules that are external to Buzz.
\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.

\paragraph{Requirement 3}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
3. It provides functionality to alter record sets in a Buzz space by uploading the relevant information that is stored in a csv file.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	
\paragraph{Required Use-Cases}
	\subparagraph{Get Thread Statistics}
	Meant to provide a versatile way to get statistical information of subsets of posts complying with specified restrictions.
	\subparagraph{Get Thread Appraisal}
	Meant to provide a versatile way to get detailed or statistical information of subsets of posts complying with specified restrictions and their associated appraisals assigned by specified members.	
	\subparagraph{Export Thread Appraisal}
		Meant to realise an off-line facility to apply a manual appraisal. It creates the dataset to be used that can be edited offline and allow updates to be inserted through the importThreadAppraisal function.
	\subparagraph{Import Thread Appraisal}
	Meant to realise an offline-facility to apply a manual appraisal. It is dependent on the exportThreadAppraisal function
	\subparagraph{Export Thread}
	Meant to provide means to back up the content of a thread or subset of a thread in a serialised text file.
	\subparagraph{Import Thread}
	Meant to provide means to restore the content of a thread or subset of a thread that was stored using the exportThread function
	
\paragraph{Test Coverage Analysis}
This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test. 
Thus there was a 0 percent completion rate for this phase of the mini project.
