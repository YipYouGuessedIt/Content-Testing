	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.

\paragraph{Requirement 2 - Upload CSV}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
	It provides functionality to alter record sets in a Buzz space by uploading the relevant information that is stored in a csv file.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	
\paragraph{Requirement 3 - Get Thread Appraisal}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
Meant to provide a versatile way to get detailed or statistical information of subsets of posts complying with specified restrictions and their associated appraisals assigned by specified members.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	 	
\paragraph{Requirement 4 - Export Thread Appraisal}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
	Meant to realise an off-line facility to apply a manual appraisal. It creates the dataset to be used that can be edited off-line and allow updates to be inserted through the importThreadAppraisal function.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	
\paragraph{ Requirement 5 - Import Thread Appraisal}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
	Meant to realise an offline-facility to apply a manual appraisal. It is dependent on the exportThreadAppraisal function.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	
\paragraph{ Requirement 6 - Export Thread}
\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
	Meant to provide means to back up the content of a thread or subset of a thread in a serialised text file.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	
\paragraph{Requirement 7 - Import Thread}
	\subparagraph{Expected functionality}
	Meant to provide means to restore the content of a thread or subset of a thread that was stored using the exportThread function.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test.
	
\paragraph{Test Coverage Analysis}
This test was a failure, due to the fact that the files that were meant to be uploaded for Group A reporting were not added to the final github commit, thus there are no files to test. 
Thus there was a 0 percent completion rate for this phase of the mini project.
