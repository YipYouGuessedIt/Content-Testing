\paragraph{Submit a Post}
	\subparagraph{Expected Test output}
	To Submit a Post the following needs to be intergrated:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item User's status points needs to be incremented (Status)
			\item The total number of posts for that thread needs to be increased (Reporting)
			\item The total number of active members in a thread needs to be increased (if user is new in thread) (Reporting)
			\item Should be able to add a resource to a post (Resources)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was a failure for the following reasons
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Intergration team didn't use threads functional team's code(only Resources and Reporting are added).
			\item No integration between the other modules (status, reporting or resources).
		\end{itemize}
