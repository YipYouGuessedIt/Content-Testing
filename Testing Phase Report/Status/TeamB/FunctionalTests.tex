\paragraph{Requirement 1 - Get Status For Profile}
	\subparagraph{Expected Functionality}
	This test must provide the ability to assess a number of measures around individual Buzz Space contributions.
	
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This test was successful as it provides ways to create new ways in which a profile status is calculated for a BuzzSpace. The only problem was that the needed 			authorisation was not implemented where it must have been. Only lecturers are supposed to be able to create these new ways. 
		

\paragraph{Requirement 2 - Calculate Access Level}
	\subparagraph{Expected Functionality}
	Be able to use the newly created ways of calculating a status for a profile on a Buzz Space.
	
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	This function was implemented successfully,  but the specific Buzz Space for which this new calculation method must  added was never specified.

\paragraph{Requirement 3 - Assess Profile}
 	\subparagraph{Expected Functionality}
	The user will be shown the profile they wish to access.	
	\subparagraph{Actual Test output}
	Not a success because of the following contract services being denied:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item No authorisation was done, thus all users could add a new way of calculating a status and not lecturers only.
	\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Requirement 4 - Create Appraisal Type}
	\subparagraph{Expected Functionality}
	User should be able to create an appraisal type, which includes the upload of appraisal images done by resources.	
	\subparagraph{Actual Test Output}
	Not a success because of the following contract services being denied:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item The specific Buzz Space for which the status calculation method must be changed was never specified or used to change the method. 
	\end{itemize}	

\paragraph{Requirement 5 - Assign Appraisal To Post}
	\subparagraph{Expected Functionality}
	Appraisal type should be assigned to the post(s).
	\subparagraph{Actual test Output}
	This use case was not implemented in the file from the final commit.
	
\paragraph{Requirement 6 - Activate Appraisal Type}
	\subparagraph{Expected Functionality}
	Activate the appraisal type for grading.
	\subparagraph{Actual Test Output}
